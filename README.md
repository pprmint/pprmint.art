# pprmint.art (Next.js)

## Setup

`npm install pnpm` because pnpm is cool.

`pnpm install` to get a fuckton of packages.

`pnpm dev` to look at the site on localhost:3000.

Note the [.env.example](.env.example) file. If you decide to clone this repo, run the site locally, and want to try out my manky contact form, make sure to provide your own details (host, port, username and password for the SMTP user, and the email address of the message recipient) in a `.env` file.
